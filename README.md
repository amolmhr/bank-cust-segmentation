# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Algorithm

## Overview

This project focuses on customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm. Customer segmentation is the practice of dividing a company's customers into groups that reflect similarity among customers in each group. This can help businesses tailor their marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains various features related to customer demographics and purchasing behavior. Ensure that the dataset is preprocessed and cleaned before applying the K-Means algorithm.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Implementation

1. **Load the Dataset**: Load the dataset using pandas.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale the features.
3. **Apply K-Means Algorithm**: Use the K-Means algorithm from scikit-learn to segment the customers.
4. **Visualize the Clusters**: Use matplotlib and seaborn to visualize the resulting clusters.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bank-cust-segmentation.git
cd bank-cust-segmentation
```

2. Run the segmentation script:

```bash
python segment_customers.py
```

## Results

The results of the customer segmentation will be saved in the `results` directory. Visualizations of the clusters will also be generated to help understand the segmentation.
